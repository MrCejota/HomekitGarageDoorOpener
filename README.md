# HomekitGarageDoorOpener

Arduino Script using and ESP8266 Board to control a garage door via Apple Homekit

This is an attempt at utilizing a single ultrasonic sensor to detect of the door is open or not. 

It seems to work well for Homekit controlled opening and closing of the doors. But if the door were to be opened up by any other means, the door status report in Homekit becomes inaccurate.
